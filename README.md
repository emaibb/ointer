# Ointer

This crate provides a set of traits and macros to enable the creation of custom pointers in Rust, allowing for the storage of extra information in the high bits of a pointer. This extra information can be of various types, and the crate provides utilities for working with these custom pointers efficiently. The crate also offers convenient macros for defining custom `ointer`s and `enum ointers` and managing them.
